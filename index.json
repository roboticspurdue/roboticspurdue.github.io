As a case study, we present the design and development of a two-finger soft gripper and exploit it as an example to demonstrate the application scenario of our mathematical model based on screw theory. A mathematical formulation based on screw theory is then presented to model gripper dynamics. The proposed formulation is the extension of a model previously introduced including the mechanical system dynamics. In this type of gripper, it is possible to achieve different behaviors, e.g., different fingertip trajectories, equivalent fingertip stiffness ellipsoids, etc., while keeping the same kinematic structure of the gripper and varying the properties of its passive deformable joints. These properties can be varied in the prototype by properly regulating some manufacturing parameters, such as percentage of printing infill density in a 3D printing process. We performed experiments with the prototype of the gripper and an optical tracking system to validate the proposed mathematical formulation, and to compare its results with other simplified formulations. We furthermore identified the main performance of the gripper in terms of payload and maximum horizontal resisted force, and verified the capabilities of the gripper to grasp objects with different shapes and weights.","tags":null,"title":"Compliant gripper design, prototyping, and modeling using screw theory formulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Irfan Hussain","Oraib Al-Ketan","Federico Renda","Monica Malvezzi","Domenico Prattichizzo","Lakmal Seneviratne","Rashid K Abu Al-Rub","Dongming Gan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582588800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582588800,"objectID":"b4a2b230eac95a3e675c1ed88e64e7f6","permalink":"https://roboticspurdue.github.io/publication/hussain2020design/","publishdate":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hussain2020design/","section":"publication","summary":"Advances in soft robotics and material science have enabled rapid progress in soft grippers. The ability to 3D print materials with softer, more elastic materials properties is a recent development and a key enabling technology for the rapid development of soft robots. However, obtaining the desired mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness) of the soft joints and information about the parameters to select in 3D printers is often not straightforward. In this article, we propose the use of interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) materials with mathematically generated topologies based on triply periodic minimal surfaces for the development of soft grippers with desired mechanical properties. The flexible joints of the gripper can be realized through two or more phases that are topologically interconnected such that each phase represents a standalone cellular structure. As a case study, we present the design and development of a two-finger soft gripper as an example to demonstrate the application scenario of our approach. The flexible parts with desired stiffness values are realized by using IPCs materials in which the reinforcement distribution can be regulated on the basis of mathematical models. We characterized the properties of the material through a set of quantitative experiments on IPCs material specimens, and then we realized qualitative grasping tests with the gripper and a set of objects with different shapes and sizes. We showed that by properly regulating the properties of IPCs material it is possible to design modular grippers with the same structure, but different closure motions. Grippers can be customized for different tasks by easily assembling and disassembling fingers.","tags":null,"title":"Design and prototyping soft–rigid tendon-driven modular grippers using interpenetrating phase composites materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://roboticspurdue.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://roboticspurdue.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://roboticspurdue.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
